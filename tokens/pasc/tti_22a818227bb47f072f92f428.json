    "overview":{
	"en":"PascalCoin describes itself as a ‘next generation’ cryptocurrency that aims to address the issue of blockchain scalability. It reportedly has a transaction speed of 72,000TPS, a simple account number (PASA), and an architecture which enables privacy. PascalCoin introduces a low-memory GPU- and ASIC-resistant hash algorithm called Random Hash. This CPU-native algorithm strives towards mining decentralization by combining hash primitives in a serial manner in conjunction with a branch-heavy and recursive implementation. PascalCoin uses a cryptographic data-structure known as the ‘SafeBox’ which functions as a dynamic ledger of all account balances."
